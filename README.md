# Ratatooey

This is a simple bot for creating a Secret-Santa-style rotation in a Discord server. It has 2 modes:

- Automatic: Everyone who joins a rotation is given the name of another user, but does not know who anyone else has received.
- Manual: Everyone sees all the names of people who have not been selected yet, and can choose one of them (but not themselves). Again, they cannot see who anyone else has selected.

I will add more here once I have more of the bot done.
